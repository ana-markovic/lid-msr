# Techrank Crossflow with the Bidding Scheduler
This project implements the LID MSR workflow seeking the co-occurences of different model-driven technologies in GitHub repositories (as described in **Section 4.1 of the thesis**) using the Crossflow framework extended with the **Bidding scheduler** to execute the the described workflow in a controlled, local environment.

## âœ… Prerequisites
Java (JDK 11+)
Docker
Maven

## ðŸš€ How to Run
### 1. Setup the ActiveMQ and Redis
Make sure you have `activemq with jmx` up and running.

```bash
docker rm -f activemq && \
docker run -p 61616:61616 --name=activemq -p 8161:8161 -p 1099:1099 -d antonw/activemq-jmx
```

### 2. Compile the Crossflow Project
```
cd bidding-modeldriven
mvn clean
mvn compile
```

### 3.  Run the Experiments via Test Methods
Experiments are located in:
```org.crossflow.tests.techrank.TechrankMetricsTests```


Each method in this class corresponds to a unique combination of job and worker configurations. You may run a specific test using your IDE or with Maven test commands if configured.

Example:
```
TechrankMetricsTests.testConfOneSlow_allDiff100_10_10();
TechrankMetricsTests.testConfFastSlow_allDiff40_40_40();
...
```
### 4. Output
After execution, metric files will be written directly to the **root project directory**.
