# Techrank NPM Real Data - Crossflow Baseline
This project implements a real-world version of the MSR workflow, focusing on the co-occurrence of popular NPM libraries within GitHub repositories. It uses the Crossflow framework in its baseline configuration and is prepared to be run on AWS or similar cluster (can be used locally too)
