# Techrank Spark
This experiment implements the LID MSR workflow introduced in **Section 4.1 of the thesis**, which searches for the co-occurrence of model-driven engineering technologies in open-source GitHub repositories. The implementation uses Apache Spark to execute the the described workflow in a controlled, local environment.
