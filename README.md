# LID-MSR: Locality-Intensive Distributed Mining of Software Repositories

This repository contains the complete research artefact accompanying the thesis:

**"Locality-Aware Scheduling of Software Repository Mining Workflows in Heterogeneous Environments"**  
Author: Ana Markovic  
Institution: University of York  
Thesis Document: `add_link_when_published`

The work investigates job scheduling strategies for mining software repositories (MSR) at scale, with a focus on locality-intensive workflows and decentralised scheduling in environments where workers may possess varying physical characteristics.
